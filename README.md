# Kaggle-Titanic-Survival-Prediction
First Kaggle Project

After using Kaggle dataset resources for a few academic projects, I want to start my own project with the Titanic dataset.

In this project, I will first use mice to impute the missing values, then visualize the data with ggplot, I haven't decided which algorithm to use for the prediction.

Let's get started!
